# 🎓 Equal Path – Education Equity Game

## 🌍 Overview

**Equal Path** is a web-based interactive card game that explores the challenge of achieving educational equity while maintaining financial sustainability.
Players act as policymakers who must balance **Equity** and **Budget** through 10 strategic decisions — every policy comes with trade-offs.

The game highlights the complexity of education systems and encourages players to think critically about resource allocation, fairness, and long-term impact.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

Your mission as the policymaker:

* Maintain **Equity ≥ 70**
* Keep **Budget ≥ 0**
* Survive through **10 turns** without running out of funds

Each round introduces new policies that may increase educational fairness at the cost of funding — or vice versa.

---

## 🕹 Gameplay

1. Click **Start Game** on the menu screen.
2. Three random **policy cards** appear each turn.
3. Each card affects **Equity** and **Budget** differently.
4. Choose wisely — the right balance between inclusivity and financial stability determines your success.
5. Reach the 10th round with both metrics stable to win!

## 💡 Social Impact

**Equal Path** addresses one of the most pressing social issues in **Vietnam and Australia** — the **inequality of access to education**.

Through this game, players learn about:

* The **urban–rural education gap**
* The **trade-offs between equality and economic constraints**
* The **importance of sustainable social investment**
* How **policy design** influences the next generation’s opportunities

The goal is not just to “win,” but to **understand** how difficult it is to create a fair and inclusive education system.
