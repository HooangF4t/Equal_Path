Prompt:
I want to design a simple browser-based educational card game that raises awareness about social inequality in education.
The game should have simple mechanics — each turn, the player chooses between 3 policy cards that change “equity” and “budget.”
After 10 turns, the player wins if equity ≥ 70 and budget ≥ 0.

Please help me brainstorm:
- Game name and concept
- Main goal
- Visual style (2D, minimal)
- Emotions or message the player should feel
- 2–3 examples of policy cards

Model Response (summarized):
Game title: Equal Path
Concept: A policymaker simulation about balancing education funding and fairness.
Visual: 2D cards with icons (school, coins, children), warm tones.
Sample cards:
- “Fund Rural Schools” (+10 equity, -20 budget)
- “Cut Teacher Grants” (-15 equity, +30 budget)
- “Community Tutoring Program” (+5 equity, -10 budget)
Goal: Maintain both equity and fiscal stability across 10 turns.
