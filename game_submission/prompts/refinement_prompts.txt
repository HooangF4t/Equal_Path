Prompt:
The “Equal Path” web game works, but I want to refine and polish it.
Please suggest improvements for:
- Game pacing (turn feedback, animations)
- UI/UX (buttons, colors, readability)
- Replayability
- Educational clarity (help players understand meaning of each card)

Also suggest 3–5 short code snippets to:
- Add a simple transition animation when selecting a card.
- Show win/lose message in a styled overlay.
- Allow “Play Again” button on result screen.

Model Response (summarized):
Suggestions:
- Add a short delay (300ms) when flipping a card.
- Use smooth color transitions for score changes.
- Add text “You achieved equitable education!” or “Funding crisis!” for endgame feedback.
- Include “Restart Game” button linking to resetGame().
- Code snippet provided for overlay and reset functionality.
